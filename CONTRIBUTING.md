Maniifold Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement"), v1.0
You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to Maniifold ("Maniifold"). Except for the license granted herein to Maniifold and recipients of software distributed by Maniifold, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions.
"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Maniifold. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Maniifold for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Maniifold (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Maniifold or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Maniifold for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

2. Grant of Copyright License.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Maniifold and to recipients of software distributed by Maniifold a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Maniifold and to recipients of software distributed by Maniifold a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license.
If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Maniifold, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Maniifold.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation.
(See section 7 for submissions on behalf of others.) You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions.
Except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation:
You may submit it to Maniifold separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

8. Non-Compete Clause.
You acknowledge and agree that, for a period of up to two years from the date of your last commit to the project, You shall not knowingly use any third-party code, software, or intellectual property that You did not write or do not have the legal right to use in any competing business or project. This applies to any software or code You have access to through your Contributions to Maniifold or any other project or business related to Maniifold.

This clause is intended to ensure that You do not, either directly or indirectly, participate in activities or contribute to any projects that use code or software not originally authored by You or not legally permitted for use in any competitive business or product without proper authorization.

Your original code contributions and rights to use or license your own Contributions for other purposes remain unaffected by this clause, but it prohibits the use of code from external sources that You do not own or have the right to use in competing activities against Maniifoldâ€™s projects or business operations within the two-year period.

9. Distribution Restriction.
You agree that You shall not distribute, share, or make available any part of the code base, including any contributions or derivative works, to any third party that has not been expressly approved in writing by the code owner. This includes, but is not limited to, sharing with individuals, organizations, or entities outside of the approved contributors or recipients authorized by Maniifold. Any violation of this restriction may result in the termination of the rights granted under this Agreement.

10. Notification of Changes.
You agree to notify Maniifold of any facts or circumstances that you become aware of that would make any of the representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect. This includes any changes in the legal or intellectual property status of your contributions or any related third-party rights that may impact your ability to comply with this Agreement.

11. Indemnification.
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Maniifold, its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and assigns from and against any and all claims, actions, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, settlements, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your breach of any representations and warranties in this Agreement.

12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.
This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. Any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be heard solely by a state or federal court in Singapore, and the parties hereby waive any objection to the jurisdiction of these courts over the parties.
